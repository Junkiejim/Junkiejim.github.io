<p>This page is where I keep my music blog. Every Friday I will post some progressive rock and/or progressive metal band that I've been listening to lately, and a short blurb about them. The purpose of this is not only for me to share what I like, which I hope some other people will like, but also to give me a little bit of practice writing. I think I need the practice at writing because I honestly don't think I'm great at it.</p>
  <h2> May 14th 2016: A.C.T.</h2>
<p> Discover music! It seems that week in and week out every band I recommend on here is either from Scandinavia, Australia, or Seattle. This week's band is from Scandinavia, so that tradition continues. A.C.T. is a Swedish progressive rock band similar to the newer age of Spock's Beard (mentioned earlier). They've been active since 1995, but haven't had the most prolific release schedule. To date they've only released 5 albums. Their most recent is called "Circus Pandemonium", and is a concept album about, you guessed it, a circus.</p>
<p>Their sound reminds me quite a lot of Spock's Beard, with a sprinkle of Genesis and the odd touch of Dream Theater. You might also compare them to Super Tramp. <a href= 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS7NkDZ4u1o'>Here's a sample</a> from their newest album.</p>


  <h2> April 29th 2016: Closure In Moscow</h2>
<p>Discover Music! I realize that I missed last week. That's okay though because I hadn't found anything new that I'd enjoyed in a while and had been just listening to Rishloo's albums on repeat. They're really good if you haven't checked them out yet. This week I've found a band from Australia called Closure in Moscow.</p>
<p>Closure in Moscow is a fairly new outfit, only active since 2008. Their sound is actually quite a bit like another Australian band I've mentioned on here, Dead letter circus. If I had to make a different comparison though, I'd say they're like Coheed and Cambria meets Cage the Elephant. The band has released 3 albums so far, the first two having a fairly mainstream sound, while the third album, "Pink Lemonade", is pretty weird. Weird in a good way.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOW3JAZ9MoQ">here's a sample</a> from that weird album, because its what got me interested. Its a little long at 8 minutes 19 seconds, but worth it.</p>

  <h2> April 14th 2016: Rishloo</h2>
	<p>This weeks band is from Seattle. They're super interesting because they're completely independent. All of their albums have been funded either by themselves or through crowdsourcing. Their most recent album "Living as Ghosts with Buildings as Teeth" was the result of a kickstarter campaign. They've also got this awesome thing where you can listen to all of their albums on their <a href="http://www.rishloo.com">website</a>.</p>

<p>They have a really great sound, a little bit like a more dynamic Mars Volta, or a more upbeat Tool (somewher in the middle I think). A lot of their songs have good ups and downs, and they like to play with delay in their guitar riffs, and their singer has a great voice. These 3 things are pretty much the recipe for getting my attention.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5herNd1r_xc">Here's</a> a sample from the 3rd album "Feathergun" </p>

 <h2> April 7th 2016: Porcupine Tree</h2>
	<p> Porcupine Tree is a band based out of England, which started off as just Steven Wilson's project. After about 6 years of doing the whole solo project thing, Steven decided to bring in some musicians. The most notable of which (to me) being drummer Gavin Harrison. He's the best.</p>
<p>They've got a spacey sound, much like Animals era Pink Floyd, and as a result some of their earlier songs tend to get into the 20+ minute range of actually unlistenable jammy jazz stuff. On the other hand, if you sift through the unlistenable early stuff, there are definitely a few gems. The musical direction has been getting heavier in the past 10 years, starting with either "deadwing" or "in absentia", I'm not sure which was first.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh9osYZNilU">Here's</a> a favourite of mine from their catalogue.</p>

<h2> March 30th 2016: Soen</h2>
<p>Do you like Tool? Are you sick of waiting for a new Tool album? You should check out Soen! Releasing albums at a rate of 1 album every 2 years, you won't likely have to wait the ridiculous time of 10 years for a new album.</p>
<p>The band is technically a "supergroup", consisting of the drummer from Opeth, the bassist from Testament/Death/Sadus, the vocalist from Willowtree and a guitarist (because we all know guitarists are a dime a dozen). Their music sounds like Tool, with some influences the obvious places (the member's other bands). Anyway, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqvBX3EQQwQ">here's</a> a taste.</p>

<h2> March 23rd 2016: Frost* </h2>
<p>This week's band is a British band by the name of Frost*. The * is not a typo. The band has been very quiet on the recording scene, only releasing 2 albums since their formation in 2004. Their music is very similar to classic progressive rock, like what you would find from early dream theater, more modern rush or 80s Yes. You could also make a very good comparison between them and Spock's beard which I posted about earlier. Their song writing seems to favour longer complicated songs, but don't let that turn you off, the band is very good and even the longer songs deserve a listen, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdQTYN05wqs">this one.</a></p>

<h2> March 16th 2016: Dead Letter Circus</h2>
<p>Discover Music! This week's band hails from Brisbane Australia. I wouldn't quite call them a progressive rock band, more like an alternative rock band with some progressive elements mixed into their song writing. In that respect, they're similar to some other bands I've featured on here like "Nothing More", "Thank you Scientist" and "Minus the Bear".</p>
<p>Dead Letter Circus has been active since 2004. The band's lineup has been fairly stable over their short tenure, with a change of drummers occuring in 2008, and a few recent changes in guitarists. With the recent departure of guitarist Mob Maric, the main creative elements are provided by vocalist Kim Benzie, although they've described their writing process as "Spontaneous and improvisational". To date they've released 3 full length albums and 3 EPs.</p>
<p>The sound that they have cultivated has two very distinct elements to it. One element is the high, clear vocals that Benzie provides, reminding me of the Mars Volta. The other element is the amount of delay that the guitarists use to create interesting, quick sounding guitar parts that don't seem to be necessarily too hard to play. It all comes together to make some pretty good songs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd81KOOxBWQ">Here</a> is the first song from their debut, self-titled EP.</p>


<h2>March 11th 2016: Anathema</h2>
<p>Music Discovery day: Friday edition! I forgot about this on Wednesday. This British band started in 1990 as a Death Metal band, but have since made a transition to a much cleaner sound. Almost nothing about their sound now can be called metal. They've dropped the harsh growling vocals, introduced a lot of atmospheric sounds, replaced the heavy electric guitar with lighter acoustic guitars, and picked up a female singer. (Not that female singers can't front metal bands (See Destiny Potato from earlier). )</p>
<p>Their sound now is closer to Radiohead's than metal, and is just generally really pretty. Their songs generally have some sort of catchy hook in the chorus, and 3 of the 6 band members sing regularly, depending on what the song calls for. The band is essentially made up of two families. The Three Cavanagh brothers, Daniel, Jamie and Vincent cover guitar, bass, keyboards and 2/3 of the vocals, and are 3 of the 4 remaining founding members. John Douglas and his sister Lee Douglas provide more keyboards and lead vocals. The band is rounded out by drummer Daniel Cardoso (Up until 2012 John Douglas actually played drums, so the band was just the 2 families for a while).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjAHS4pNUY8">Here's a song</a> from their 2014 album Distant Satellites.</p>
  
<h2>March 2nd 2016: Beardfish</h2>
<p>Discover Music! Beardfish!</p>
<p>These Swedish prog rockers have been a favourite of mine since highschool. They were one of the two bands, along with Pain of Salvation, that were supposed to open for Dream Theater in Toronto during the progressive nation tour 2009. Due to their record label going bankrupt they weren't actually able to make it to north america for the tour, and we were instead treated to Big Elf and Scale the Summit (more about them a different day perhaps).</p>
<p>Beardfish is one of those great bands that has a lot of talent, and some complex song writing, but really doesn't take themselves seriously. Their songs (at least in their early stuff) is generally filled with jokes and just outright weirdness. Not taking themselves too seriously has also let them release a lot of albums since they got started. Their first album (The Sane Day) was released in 2005, which was a 2 disc concept album. Since then they've released 7 other albums (8 total). For comparison Tool has been active since 1993 and has released 5 albums, the Red Hot Chilli Peppers have been active since 1984 and have released 10 albums. Basically, these guys have been very productive.</p>
<p>My favourite album of theirs is "Sleeping in Traffic Part 2". It is their 4th album, and is a somewhat silly concept album. The album is about a night on the town, starting out with "sunset" and ending with the title track, a 34 minute long odyssey where I assume the focal character of the album fell asleep in the cab on the way home and had a really fucked up dream. Its a good song, if you've got a long time to listen to it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d552_v06xw">This song</a> is about someone encountered at the bar, named Garth, and his back story. It gets very silly in the middle.</p>

<h2>February 24th 2016: Myrath </h2>
<p>Discover music! I found an interesting mixture of music types the other week, basically what we have here is progressive metal and Bollywood. The band is Myrath, from Tunisia, and they call their subgenre of metal "Oriental Metal"</p>
<p>Myrath have been active since 2001, and have been releasing albums at a Tool-like pace, with 4 albums in the past 15 years, one of those was released 2 weeks ago. Guitarist Malek Ben Arbia is the only remaining founding member, and is currently 28, meaning that he was at the ripe old age of 13 when they got started. The band has since been through a major lineup change, replacing everyone but Arbia in 2004. Since then they have been through about 3 drummers.</p>
<p>The musical mixture of middle eastern styles and metal doesn't sound like it would mesh really well, but they make it work and it sounds fantastic. This band is, in my opinion, one of the best finds I've made this year, possibly behind Caligula's horse. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMvqMHST2Is">Here</a> is an example of what they've got goin' on.</p>

<h2>February 17th 2016: Queensryche </h2>
<p>Discover Music! This week's band is an old one. Queensryche got their start in 1982, out of Washington state. Initially, the band was more successful in Japan than they were in North america, their first few albums had some minor success but they really hit it big in the late 1988 with "Operation Mindcrime", which is often listed as one of the masterpieces of progressive metal, along with "Blackwater Park" by Opeth and "Images and Words" by dream theater.</p>
<p>As you may have noticed, I have kinda a thing for vocalists, and Geoff Tate is really the man that got that all started. He has the distinctive high flying power that is synonymous with power metal bands. He doesn't quite have the power of other metal greats like Bruce Dickinson or Ronnie James Dio. But his range and control of his upper register is unparalleled. Some of the notes he hits when he was in his prime are just mind blowingly high and clear.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the early 90s, the guitarist and main song writer Chris Degarmo left the band, and the song quality never quite recovered. The other big piece of the band, vocalist Geoff Tate was fired after a fight back stage of one of their shows in 2012. Queensryche still continues to record and tour, but understandably they're not quite the same.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtorYolc-Cc">This song</a> I think shows off Geoff's vocals really well.</p>

<h2> February 10th 2016: Polyphia</h2>
<p>Music Discovery! Who ever said Metal can't be pretty?</p>
<p>Polyphia is a very new progressive metal band from Dallas, Texas. They've been on the scene only since 2011, with only one full length album released so far. They're an instrumental band, no singers, not yet at least. They often feature guest guitarists on their tracks, and get some really interesting melodies and solos out of their guests. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WpgmYshzpA">Here's a favourite.</a></p>

<h2>February 3rd 2016: Devin Townsend</h2>
<p>Music Discovery Day!</p>
<p>Devin Townsend is somewhere between the metal version of Trent Reznor, and the metal version of Frank Zappa. He writes, produces, and records almost all of his own music like Reznor, and a lot of the music he makes is serious progressive music, with silly lyrics like Zappa. Also like Trent Reznor and Nine-Inch Nails, Townsend's music tends to sound very industrial.</p>
<p>My favourite album of his is "Ziltoid the Omniscient", which I probably listen to about once a month. "Ziltoid the Omniscient" is a concept album about intergalactic warlord Ziltoid. At the beginning of the album Ziltoid feels like some coffee, so he demands that the people of earth provide him with their best cup of coffee. When he receives the coffee he is extremely disappointed and decides he's going to attack earth.</p>
<p>There is a follow up album to Ziltoid called "Z²", which cover's Ziltoid's feud with the War Princess (played by Dominique Lenore Persi of Stolen Babies), the planet earth, and pretty much everyone. Z² has quite a lot more storyline than "Ziltoid the Omniscient", and consequently feels a little over done. Anyway, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo3oddlzUYM">here's a song from the first Ziltoid.</a></p>

<h2>January 27th 2016: Amaranthe</h2>
<p>Have you ever been listening to Britney Spears or Rihanna and thought "I wish this was heavier"? I know I have, as much as I love those girls, their music could sometimes really use that extra punch. Alternatively, have you ever been listening to Killswitch Engage or Disturbed and though, "This would be better with Rhianna Singing"? Admittedly not a thought I've had before this band, but things change.</p>
<p>The Swedish metal band Amaranthe is essentially what you would get if you had your wish in either of those scenarios. They're a metal band fronted by 3 singers. The main singer, Elize Ryd does most of the choruses, which give the songs a more mainstream feel, even making them a little poppy sometimes. The other two singers use the clean vocals and growly harsh vocals that are common in metal, to add flavour and cover the verses.</p>
<p>Interesting stuff. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6PYAkXO-bU">Here's a sample</a></p>

<h2>January 20th 2016: Matt Barlow </h2>
<p>Discover Music! This week I'm going to do something a little different. I'm not going to introduce you to a particular band, but rather a particular singer.</p>
<p>Matt Barlow got his start as the 2nd lead singer for american power metal band "Iced Earth". He got originally got the job because he is guitarist Jim Schaeffer's brother in law, and they were looking for a replacement of their first singer John Greely. Matt was with Iced earth for 8 years, recording 7 albums, before he left to become a police officer. It was shortly after the September 11th attacks that he realised that he was living "the illusion of a rock star" and wanted to contribute to the real world. In 2007 he joined a Sweedish power metal band "Pyramaze". The schedule with Pyramaze was much more lax than with Iced Earth, allowing him to be a part of the music community but still maintain his job as a cop. Later in 2007 he rejoined Iced Earth, so I guess he must have really missed the music scene. In 2011 he quit again, only to form his own band "Ashes of Ares" a year later.</p>
<p>I like Matt Barlow for many reasons, but the main one is the amazing amount of power he gets into his voice, and the incredible range he distributes that power over. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogC41D26UWw">This example</a> from the 1999 live album "Alive in Athens" with Iced earth really showcases the range and power that he has, the one high note towards the end is particularly impressive, especially considering this is the tail end of a 3 hour show.</p>

<h2> January 13th 2016: Kingcrow</h2>
<p>This week's music is a little closer to the progressive rock of old. With very strong influences from Pink Floyd, Kingcrow is an up and coming band on the prog scene. This Italian group have been around since 1995 and have released 6 albums to date, I am only familiar with their more recent work (last 3 albums). Their fourth Phlegethon (Which I have been informed is one of the 5 rivers in the infernal regions of the underworld), sounds an lot like Pink floyd's division bell but heavier, which is what attracted me to them. They seem to be fairly unknown outside of europe, since their wikipedia page is only in Italian.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Giy35m410">Here's a song</a> from their newest album, Eidos. The video is a little surreal.</p>

<h2> January 6th 2016: Caligula's Horse</h2>
<p>Back after my Christmas holidays with more music! This week's music is from Australian band Caligula's Horse.
Caligula's Horse is a pretty new band (formed in 2011), but they've already released 3 albums. Their newest, Bloom, was released in October. If I had to characterize their sound, it would be either as Opeth without the growling. They're also very similar to the british band Haken which I posted earlier.</p>
<p>This song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNIP5LPuLHo">"Firelight"</a> is from their newest album, and is a little bit more mainstream friendly than some of their other stuff which tends to be a much proggier.</p>

<h2> December 16th 2015: Tauk</h2>
<p>Tauk is an instrumental quartet from Oyster Bay New York (real place). They describe their sound as "Dirty Funk", but I would call it jazz rock fusion. In a lot of cases their songs sound like what I imagine Incubus would sound like without the vocals, punchy guitar riffs with a very jazzy atmospheric background. Alternatively, they sound a bit like an instrumental Dave Matthews Band.</p>
<p>Due to the style, their songs lend themselves to improvisation very well and can get a little silly with the jams. I've heard that they have excellent live shows, and the live album of theirs that I've heard supports that. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT2bEbaW_-c&list=PLkS0Om5Ekvzr5HxoK9yYTlVN8r6dSJNrt&index=10'>Here's a sample</a> from their 2013 album Homunculus.</p>

<h2> December 9th 2015: Thank You Scientist</h2>

<p>Music Day! I discovered this band last week, and fell in love pretty quickly. Thank you Scientist consists of 7 people, a guitarist, a saxaphone player, a trumpet player, a singer, a bassist, a drummer and a violinist. They're very new to the music scene, releasing their first E.P. in 2011 called "The Perils of Time Travel", followed a year later by their first full length album called "Maps of Non-Existent Places".</p>
<p>Their sound is a really fun mixture of Prog Rock, Metal, Jazz Fusion & Folk music with some nice poppy hooks. One of the things that got me most interested in them at first was that I swore I recognized the singer's voice. I've decided that he sounds like a mixture of the guy from Moist, the guy from Incubus and Maynard James Keenan from Tool. If you can think of a better description, that would be fantastic and it would put my mind at ease.</p>
<p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy_Dv25KmPE'>Here's a song from the perils of time travel.</p>
